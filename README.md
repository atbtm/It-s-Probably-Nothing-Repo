<h3>pass-by-value vs pass-by-ref</h3>
* pass-by-value: pass in the variable that points to the address. Any changes to the variable/content of address will affect caller.
* pass-by-ref: pass in a new variable that points to the address. Changes to the variable will not reflect back to the caller. Only content change will reflect, because the two addresses are pointing to the same object. Primary type is data itself.
